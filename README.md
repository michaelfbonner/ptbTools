**ptbTools** is a set of tools for implementing common routines in
[PsychToolbox][1]. The goals of this toolbox are:

[1]: <http://psychtoolbox.org>

 

-   Simplify the coding of PsychToolbox experiments

-   Make experiments cleaner and easier to debug

 

PsychToolbox is a powerful set of Matlab functions for creating and running
psychology and neuroscience experiments. It affords fine-grained control of
timing and stimulus presentation. ptbTools provides high-level functions for
implementing common PsychToolbox routines, with a particular focus on
neuroimaging experiments (e.g., computing reaction times, displaying stimuli,
locking experiment timing to the timing of the fMRI scanner).

 

To get started, download ptbTools and PsychToolbox and add them to you search
path in Matlab. Start coding an experiment. Example experiment scripts coming
soon.

 

**Documentation**

 

See the Documentation folder. TABLE\_OF\_CONTENTS.html contains brief
descriptions of all code files. Further documentation, along with topic tagging,
is contained in this [Notebook.][2]

**Important caveat**

 

This toolbox is in development. All functions are new and untested. This code is
distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty—without
even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
