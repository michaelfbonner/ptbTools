**ptbTools** is a set of tools for implementing common routines in
[PsychToolbox][1]. The goals of this toolbox are:

[1]: <http://psychtoolbox.org>

 

-   Simplify the coding of PsychToolbox experiments

-   Make experiments cleaner and easier to debug

 

PsychToolbox is a powerful set of Matlab functions for creating and running
psychology and neuroscience experiments. It affords fine-grained control of
timing and stimulus presentation. ptbTools provides high-level functions for
implementing common PsychToolbox routines, with a particular focus on
neuroimaging experiments (e.g., computing reaction times, displaying stimuli,
locking experiment timing to the timing of the fMRI scanner).

 

To get started, download ptbTools and PsychToolbox, add them to your search path
in Matlab, and start coding an experiment (example experiment scripts coming
soon).

 

**Documentation**

Download [htmlTools][2], which will be used to generate HTML documentation for
this project. Add it to your search path in Matlab. Run the file
CodeDescriptions.m in the ptbTools directory. This will generate in a new
directory (Documentation) with HTML documentation for all functions. Brief
descriptions of all functions can be found in TABLE\_OF\_CONTENTS.html.

**Important caveat**

This toolbox is in development. All functions are new and untested. This code is
distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty—without
even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. Use at your own risk!
